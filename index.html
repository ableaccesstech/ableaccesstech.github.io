            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>At AbleAccessTech, we value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the information you provide when you use our app, HearAssist. By using this app, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

            <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>Audio Data:</strong> HearAssist requires access to your deviceâ€™s microphone to record and process audio. This data is only used for the app's core functionality, such as adjusting audio levels and processing sound, and is not stored. All audio processing happens in real time on your device.</p>
            <p><strong>Bluetooth Data:</strong> The app uses Bluetooth to connect to compatible devices, such as Bluetooth earphones or other audio equipment, and check the connection state of these devices. This data is necessary for certain features of the app, but no personal information about your Bluetooth device is collected or stored.</p>
            <p><strong>Google Play Console Statistics:</strong> We use the Google Play Console to collect anonymized, aggregate data about the performance of HearAssist. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Install and Uninstall Data: Statistics on the number of installs, uninstalls, and active users.</li>
                <li>Crash Reports: Data about app crashes or errors to improve app performance.</li>
                <li>Device Information: Details about the types of devices using the app (e.g., operating system version, device model).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is used for app improvement, performance analysis, and troubleshooting. It is not personally identifiable.</p>

            <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Audio Data:</strong> The microphone data is used to record audio and adjust sound levels in real time. This data is processed on your device and is not stored.</p>
            <p><strong>Bluetooth Data:</strong> The app uses Bluetooth to connect to compatible earphones or other audio devices, allowing audio to be played through them. No personal information about your Bluetooth devices is collected or stored.</p>
            <p><strong>Google Play Console Statistics:</strong> The data collected from Google Play Console is used for performance analysis and bug fixes. It helps us understand how HearAssist is being used and how to make improvements, but it does not identify individual users.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p><strong>No Data Sharing:</strong> We do not share your personal data with third parties. There are no third-party advertising networks or services used in HearAssist.</p>
            <p><strong>Google Play Console:</strong> The anonymized data collected via the Google Play Console is shared with Google for performance analysis. This data is not personally identifiable.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Audio data is processed in real-time and is not stored beyond the duration of its use for app functionality.</p>
            <p>Data collected through Google Play Console (such as install/uninstall statistics and crash reports) is retained by Google for app performance and analysis, and is not tied to individual users.</p>

            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of data transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Opt-out of Bluetooth or microphone permissions: You can disable these permissions in your device settings at any time, although this will affect app functionality (such as recording audio or streaming to Bluetooth earphones).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with an updated "Last updated" date. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
